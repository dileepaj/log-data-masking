1)Windows Command Line

Prerequisites - CMake should be installed
		MinGW should be installed

1.Navigate to the Project Directory (log-data-masking/LDAL)
2.Execute the following commands in command prompt terminal
	mkdir build 				//make a seperate directory for the build files
	cd build
	cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"		//Command to build the CMake build file using MinGW compiler(If MinGW is not specified, cmake.. command will build using visual studio by default)
	mingw32-make				//Create the executable .exe file

2)Linux Terminal

Prerequisites - CMake should be installed
		MinGW should be installed

1.Navigate to the Project Directory (log-data-masking/LDAL)
2.Exclude the main.mm file from the CMakeLists.txt file and include the main.cpp
3.Execute the following commands in command prompt terminal
	mkdir build 			//make a seperate directory for the build files
	cd build
	cmake ..			//Command to build the CMake build file using MinGW compiler.
	make				//Create the executable .exe file



1) Clone/Download the log-data-masking repository into your local repository.
2) Create a databse named "sunstitutiondb" and add the given tables using the csv files provided in log-data-masking/substitutiondbtables
3) Insert your log file into LogMaskingTool/Files/log.txt
4) Write a suitable script for your log file that captures all the required variables into log-data-masking/Files/script.txt (Example log and script files can be found in log-data-masking/Files/Examples)
5) Enter the following details into log-data-masking/Files/maskingScript.txt file to mask sensitive information.
	    i)Enter your MySQL database connection string as follows - $DB_CONNECTION_STRING.SetDbString(hostname_username_password_databasename_port) (Example -> localhost_admin_admin_substitutiondb_0)
	   ii)Enter the variable names of the fields that require masking as follows - {$FIRST_NAME,$LAST_NAME,$TELEPHONE_NUMBER,$ADDRESS}:=LIST
	  iii)You can input one or all 16 available variable names into the above statement.
	   iv)The fields available are  FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, FULL_NAME, DATE, MONTH, YEAR, HOUR, MINUTE, SECONDS, TELEPHONE_NUMBER, ADDRESS, POSTAL_CODE, INTEGER, PRICE, NIC, EMAIL.
	    v)The variable names of the variables that you require to be masked in the script file should be same as the variable names provided in iv) above.
	   vi)Add range of replacement values for integer and price maskinbg as follows if required ($INTEGER.SetLValue(10000),$INTEGER.SetRValue(20000),$PRICE.SetLValue(10000),$PRICE.SetRValue(20000)).
	   
6) Execute the LogMaskingTool.exe found in log-data-masking/LDAL/cmake-build-debug
7) The masked log file will be created in log-data-masking/Files/maskedLog.txt
